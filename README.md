# 📚 DSA Study Hub

**Live Demo:** [https://dsa-study-hub.vercel.app/](https://dsa-study-hub.vercel.app/)

**DSA Study Hub** is an interactive educational web application designed to help students master **Data Structures and Applications (DSA)**. It features a modern, responsive interface where users can view C source code for standard laboratory programs and run interactive simulations of those algorithms directly in the browser.

- **Code Repository:** Access full, copy-ready C source code for 12+ standard DSA programs.
- **Modern UI/UX:**
  - **Dark/Light Mode** toggle for comfortable reading.
  - **Responsive Design** using Tailwind CSS.
  - **Copy-to-Clipboard** functionality for all code snippets.
- **Portfolio Section:** Integrated "About Me" section for instructor/student details.
