## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of DSA Study Hub seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities by opening a new issue in the GitHub repository.

- **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.
- Provide as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and fix the issue.

We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

### Response Timeline

We aim to acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within 48 hours. We strive to provide regular status updates during the investigation and remediation process.

### Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure policy:

- Please do not share vulnerability details publicly until we have released a fix.
- We request a 90-day embargo period for vulnerabilities (or until a fix is released, whichever is sooner) to give us time to address the issue.

- The DSA Study Hub web application

### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in accordance with this policy to be authorized. We will not take legal action against researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service.
- Only interact with accounts they own or with explicit permission from the account holder.
